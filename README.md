Does running more before marathon helps you to run marathon faster?
===========

This repository is a collection of scripts in R programming language used for producing a grading paper for a course Inferential Statistics from Udacity.com

They download dataset of around 700000 workout parameters, tracked with fitness tracker Endomondo.com, plot some graphs and run one-tailed t-test with condifence level of 99%. 

Null hypothesis: those who run longer and those who run shorter distances show similar running speed during marathon.

Result: if you run at least 50km per week or more, you will run marathon at least 0.71 km/h faster, with 99% confidence level. Probability that the difference is by chance is less than .1%.
